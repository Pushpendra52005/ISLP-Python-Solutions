# Chapter 02: Statistical Learning

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of statistical learning, distinguishing between different types of learning problems and approaches. It focuses on the roles of prediction and inference in supervised learning, along with key concepts like the bias-variance trade-off and model flexibility.

## 📖 Topics Covered

- What is Statistical Learning?
- Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
- Regression vs. Classification
- Estimating the target function f
- Bias-Variance Trade-off
- The flexibility-interpretability trade-off
- Training vs. Test error
- Introduction to K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 🧪 Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Practice basic Python syntax and commands
- Use NumPy and pandas for data manipulation
- Visualize data with matplotlib and seaborn
- Work with control structures (if, for loops)
- Load and explore datasets such as:
  - `Auto.csv`
  - `Caravan.csv`
  - `Advertising.csv`

These exercises build a foundation in Python programming for data analysis and prepare you for modeling and evaluation in later chapters.
