## 📖 Overview

Statistical learning involves tools that help us understand data — both when we have a response variable (supervised learning) and when we do not (unsupervised learning).

In this chapter, we cover:

- ✨ What is statistical learning?
- 📈 Real-world applications:
  - Wage prediction (Wage dataset)
  - Market movement classification (Smarket dataset)
  - Clustering gene expression data (NCI60 dataset)
- 🧠 Regression vs. Classification vs. Clustering
- 📚 A brief history and motivation for statistical learning
- 🧮 Introductory concepts in matrix notation and dataset structure

---

## 🧪 Lab Activities

This chapter includes a Python lab focused on:

- Getting started with Python for data science
- Basic Python commands
- Numpy and Pandas essentials
- Plotting with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Data indexing, slicing, and loading from CSV
- Control structures like loops

🔗 **Datasets used**:  
- `Wage.csv`  
- `Smarket.csv`  
- `NCI60.csv`
